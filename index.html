					<td>Balloon</td>
					<td>They are an air type of troop where they only target defenses that attack other troops. <br>When they die, they drop a bomb that deals damage to nearby buildings, <br>clan castle troops, heroes, etc. When troops are on top of the balloon when the <br>balloon is taking down a defense, they get damaged. When all defenses are destroyed, <br>the balloon attacks any building now including the town hall.</td>
					<td>Elixir Troop</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="table-danger">
					<td>Wizard</td>
					<td>They attack anything thats close to them like walls, buildings, heroes, etc. <br>They provide support when attacking like barbarian king and wizards combined, <br>they make a great combo. They do splash damage, so when heroes or clan castle troops <br>and they come across the fireball splash damage, they get damaged. Wizards are aware <br>that when there are heroes or clan castle troops going near them, they attack them, <br>so that they don't die. They Are Ground troops.</td>
					<td>Elixir Troop</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="table-dark">
					<td>Lava Hound</td>
					<td>This troop only targets defenses and an air type troop, and when all defenses are destroyed, <br>they target any building now. They have high health and when they die, they release tiny lava pups <br>that attacks any type of building near them. These lava pups are weak, but fast. <br>The Lava Hound is a very good tank at the start to distract any defenses. <br>After making the Lava Hound attack and distract defenses, the Archer Queen or Balloon can be placed <br>behind the Lava hound so that they can destroy the defenses if timed right. </td>
					<td>Dark Elixir Troop</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="table-warning">
					<td>Barbarian King</td>
					<td>A strong hero that can be also a good tank with high health and decent damage. When at your base, <br>he defends your base when it gets attacked by others. During an attack of a player's base, <br>he will have a melee that is short ranged and targets any building near him. He cannot attack air troops.</td>
					<td>Hero</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="table-warning">
					<td>Archer Queen</td>
					<td>A ranged hero who deals good damage to buildings and walls. She provides a good range of <br>5 tiles away from her target. When at base, the Archer Queen defends the base and can attack ground <br>and air troops within the 5 tiles attack range. During attacks, she can be a good support and attacker by <br>just being at the back of tanks or troops and attack any building and walls so that the troops can go in much faster.</td>
					<td>Hero</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="table-danger">
					<td>Rage</td>
					<td>Rage provides troops and heroes more speed and more damage when inside the radius.</td>
					<td>Elixir Spell</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="table-danger">
					<td>Freeze</td>
					<td>Freeze can freeze buildings, heroes, and clan castle troops. And when they get frozen from the spell radius, <br>they can't move and attack until the spell timer runs out. It doesn't freeze your troops and heroes.</td>
					<td>Elixir Spell</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="table-dark">
					<td>Haste</td>
					<td>Haste provides troops and heroes a lot more speed than rage spell. No damage boost.</td>
